						<p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
						<ul class="marbot20">
						    <li>2 cups and 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour 1 scoop Grown American Superfood</li>
							<li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
							<li>1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
							<li>2 teaspoons baking powder 1⁄4 tsp salt</li>
							<li>3 eggs</li>
							<li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
							<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
							<li>1 tablespoon melted butter (cooled)</li>
							<li>3⁄4 cup fresh blueberries</li>
							<li>Additional butter or vegetable oil for cooking</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
						<p class="marbot10">In a large bowl mix together flour, Grown AmericanTM Superfood, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until thoroughly combined. In another bowl combine the eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla. Then slowly drizzle the cooled melted butter into a wet mixture while whisking. Pour wet mixture over dry mixture and combine. Gently fold in the blueberries. The batter will be lumpy.</p>
						<p class="marbot10">Heat a griddle or nonstick pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, put about 1 teaspoon of butter or vegetable oil in the pan. When the butter foam subsides or the oil is hot, ladle out pancake mix in 1⁄8-cup measurements. Cook for about 2 minutes until the top of the pancake bubbles and the bottom turns golden brown. Very carefully flip and cook for about 2 minutes more until the bottom is golden and the pancake is cooked through.</p>
						<p>Serve immediately or hold in a warm oven while you make the remaining pancakes. Serve with warm maple syrup, butter, and/or sour cream.</p>

I help many people with chronic, degenerative disease and other types of health problems that they are not doing well with and the vast majority heal. With applied kinesiology the Grown American Superfood tests like a very good vitamin. Because it is made from produce that has been ideally grown and processed I recommend its use daily per enclosed directions and expect it will contribute significantly to healing, health and wellness, longevity and life satisfaction and enjoyment because it has maximum food value for what the body needs.</p>

							<p class="font14 italic">This is a good supplement to add to your eating plan. A great substitute for a plain glass of water. I was surprised with the taste it was actually pretty good, very flavorful and smooth. Didn't have a bitter taste like most similar products had some sweetness to it (I like that!). So far I have only used with water, plan to add it to yogurt and an add-in to some of my main meal recipes.</p>
