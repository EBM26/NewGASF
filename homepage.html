							<p class="font12 marg5">By <span class="blue">Paul</span> on May 15, 2018</p>
							<p class="marg20">I almost never review products....but want to evangelize this one because it is fantastic. I recently crossed over the hill (40) and wanted to have more of a focus on good health. Eat right and exercise....simple, but not easy. My biggest issue has been getting enough fruits and veggies in my diet, mainly because I don't like eating them. I bought a juicer and returned it within a week after realizing how much produce I would need to keep buying.....and the juice was pretty gross.</p>
							<p class="marg20">A friend told me about this Superfood concentrated powder drink that has everything I need in it. I was skeptical....but after almost two months....I'm hooked! The drink tastes great, fills me up, gives me energy, and I've lost over 15 pounds (also trying to eat better and some exercise). My wife was also very skeptical...but is now drinking it because it's organic and she is seeing my results.</p>
							<p class="marg20">There is no magic formula for weight loss and good health...but Gown American Superfood has become my magic bullet to get all my fruits and veggies a day, and that was the hardest part for me. I'd recommend this product to anyone.</p>

							<p class="font12 marg5">By <span class="blue">Robert</span> on August 22, 2018</p>
							<p>I am a holistic dentist and acupuncturist working with nutrition and applied kinesiology. I help many people with chronic, degenerative disease and other types of health problems that they are not doing well with and the vast majority heal. With applied kinesiology the Grown American Superfood tests like a very good vitamin. Because it is made from produce that has been ideally grown and processed I recommend its use daily per enclosed directions and expect it will contribute significantly to healing, health and wellness, longevity and life satisfaction and enjoyment because it has maximum food value for what the body needs.</p>

							<p>This is a good supplement to add to your eating plan. A great substitute for a plain glass of water. I was surprised with the taste it was actually pretty good, very flavorful and smooth. Didn't have a bitter taste like most similar products had some sweetness to it (I like that!). So far I have only used with water, plan to add it to yogurt and an add-in to some of my main meal recipes.</p>
